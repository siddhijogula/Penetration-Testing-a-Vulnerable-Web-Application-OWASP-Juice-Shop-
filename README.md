Introduction
This project demonstrates how to perform penetration testing on a vulnerable web application — OWASP Juice Shop — using Kali Linux and tools like Burp Suite.
It provides hands-on practice with common web vulnerabilities such as SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), File Upload Vulnerabilities, and more.

Pre-requisites
Basic understanding of web application concepts (HTTP, HTTPS, web servers)

Familiarity with command-line interface (CLI)

Basic knowledge of HTML, JavaScript, and web development

Installed Kali Linux environment

Setting Up OWASP Juice Shop
Install Docker:

bash
Copy code
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install docker.io
sudo systemctl start docker
sudo systemctl enable docker
Pull Juice Shop Docker Image:

bash
Copy code
sudo docker pull bkimminich/juice-shop
Run Juice Shop Container:

bash
Copy code
sudo docker run -d -p 3000:3000 bkimminich/juice-shop
Access Juice Shop:

Open your browser and navigate to: http://localhost:3000

Tools Used
Kali Linux — Penetration testing operating system

OWASP Juice Shop — Vulnerable web application

Docker — Application containerization

Burp Suite — Web application security testing platform

Nmap — Network scanning tool

Tasks
Task 1: Identify Open Ports
Steps:

Open a terminal on Kali Linux.

Scan the server using Nmap:

bash
Copy code
nmap 192.168.1.100
Goal: Discover open ports and services running on the OWASP Juice Shop server.

Task 2: SQL Injection
Steps:

Launch Burp Suite and set your browser's proxy to 127.0.0.1:8080.

Intercept a login request.

Input the following payload:

pgsql
Copy code
Username: ' OR '1'='1
Password: ' OR '1'='1
Goal: Bypass authentication using SQL Injection.

Task 3: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
Steps:

Find a user input field (e.g., search bar).

Insert a basic XSS payload:

html
Copy code
<script>alert('XSS')</script>
Goal: Trigger an alert box, confirming a reflected XSS vulnerability.

Task 4: File Upload Vulnerability
Steps:

Navigate to a file upload page (e.g., profile picture upload).

Attempt to upload a malicious file (e.g., a PHP reverse shell).

Goal: Verify if file upload controls are bypassable.

Task 5: Directory Traversal
Steps:

Intercept a request with Burp Suite.

Modify parameters to attempt path traversal:

bash
Copy code
../../../etc/passwd
Goal: Access sensitive files outside the web root directory.

Task 6: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
Steps:

Create a malicious HTML form that submits a request on behalf of an authenticated user.

Load the form in the browser while logged into Juice Shop.

Goal: Perform actions without user consent, demonstrating CSRF.

Expected Results
Successfully discover open ports on the target machine.

Bypass login authentication via SQL Injection.

Trigger a pop-up via XSS payload.

Upload and execute or access a malicious file.

Access sensitive server files via directory traversal.

Perform actions without authorization via CSRF attack.
